            <p className="text-gray-400 sm:text-lg">Hello world! I&apos;m Ignacio Cerda, a creative spark and friendly face nestled in the wonderful city of Malm√∂, Sweden. My journey as a junior Front-end Developer took shape at Grit Academy, a crucial step in my professional growth. It&apos;s my passion for web development and technology that keeps my wheels turning, always eager to innovate and bring ideas to life in the digital realm.</p>

            <p className="text-gray-400 sm:text-lg">Though I&apos;m a proud Spanish native, the world is my oyster! I speak Swedish fluently, and my conversational English is strong, allowing me to connect with a diverse array of people in this fascinating digital landscape. When I&apos;m not immersed in the latest tech trends, you&apos;ll often find me playing and creating music - another passion that resonates deeply with me. Let&apos;s explore the endless possibilities of the web together, and perhaps share a melody or two along the way!</p>
