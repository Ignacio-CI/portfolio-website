            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 sm:text-lg">Hello world! I&apos;m Ignacio Cerda, a creative spark nestled in the wonderful city of Malm√∂, Sweden. My journey as a Front-end Developer took shape at Grit Academy, a crucial step in my professional growth. It&apos;s my passion for web development and technology that keeps my wheels turning, always eager to innovate and bring ideas to life in the digital realm.</p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 sm:text-lg">Immersed in the dynamic world of web development, my curiosity thrives on exploring modern frameworks and languages.

            <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 sm:text-lg">Away from the world of code, you&apos;ll often find me enveloped in the universal language of music, playing and creating melodies that stir the soul. This passion for music, like my love for web development, stems from a deep-seated desire to create and inspire. Let&apos;s traverse the boundless possibilities of the web together, intertwining lines of code with notes of music, fostering a symphony of innovation and harmony along the way!</p>
